This is a repository of my(Bishop's) current mod build for minecraft 1.7.10.

It is designed to be cloned right into a minecraft instance and to 
   replace the instance's mods folder with itself, so staying up
   to date only requires pressing sync in Github.

I'm still working out how who can pull from github, so if you have any
   issues please contact me an I'll try to fix it.

If there are any problems with mods causing crashes or what not, 
   submit an issue report in github and I'll do my best to resolve it
   when fixes are released.
